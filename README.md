# Deep Learning Specialization

> This repository does not contain any solutions from the programming assignments or quizzes.

This summer (2018) I am taking Andrew Ng's [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai) on Coursera, and have created this repo to document related personal exploration and extra materials.

Below are the five courses offered in this specialization, as well as my current progress. A few correspond to a folder in this repo.
