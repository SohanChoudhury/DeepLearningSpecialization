# Deep Learning Specialization

> This repository does not contain any solutions from the programming assignments or quizzes.

This summer (2018) I am taking Andrew Ng's [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai) on Coursera, and have created this repo to document related personal exploration and extra materials.

Below are the five courses offered in this specialization, as well as my current progress. Each correspond to a folder in this repo.
